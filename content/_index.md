{{< large >}} This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) blog. It was wholely inspired from [Start a Fucking Blog](https://startafuckingblog.com). If you'd prefer a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) blog, seriously go check that out. {{< /large >}}

**This is not a theme.**

This repo is not meant to be a Hugo theme, but more of a starting point with just enough features and demos to get you going. It's based on the beautiful [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org) framework. You can learn to add new features as you need them.

## Getting Started

First, I recommend that you [clone this repository from this template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template "Creating a repository from a template").

1. Edit the `hugo.toml` file with your blog's information.
2. Replace the home page's content in `content/index.md`.
3. Replace the `content/blog` files with your own posts (leave `_index.md` though).
4. Edit the footer in `partials/site-footer.html`.
